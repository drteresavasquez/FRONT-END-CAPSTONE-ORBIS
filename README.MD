# Read the Room: Developing More Than Code

What if you could measure more than coding expertise from your experience at NSS? Teamwork and organizations more than ever need developers with more than the ability to code. This is why if someone knows you personally, regardless of skills other than the minimum necessary to perform the job, you are more likely to be hired to their organization if the opportunity presents itself.
The deal is if you want to be successful, you can’t only be either all code focused or social focused; there has to be balance between the two. Read the Room gives users the ability to balance both aspects while learning also about what makes a great teammate by focusing on their own communication and conflict styles and then on those they work with through tech exercises and events.
## The Problem:
Currently the issue is as a new student at NSS it can be overwhelming to hear that you will need to both learn to code and balance networking in order to have positive impact on your future career. First, admin sends new students a link with all the books they will need to read and all the pre-work that is HIGHLY recommended (which is actually essential for success in the program) but then on the first day students also learn that there is more that is required to being employable and successful in the program like social skills.
However, perhaps you are like many other people, you like people and people like you, but you already know those people (or are related to them)….With the strain of time you’re wondering how you can learn all the essential tech skills AND be a good teammate while also developing deeper relationships all while networking. To top it off, within the first few days of your boot camp, you get to witness all of the mind blowing front end capstones and begin to think: ‘what the hell am I doing here?’

Read the Room takes off the initial shell shock of the environment by including students in personality houses, cohorts, and exercises in a simple and fun way. Read the Room also equips teachers with the ability to provide valuable feedback to students. Teachers also have the ability to group teams based on more than skills or exercises completed. They can see what students’ tech and social goals are, what skills they have acquired so not too many with the same skillset or social goals are grouped together all the time.

### Features
- Gamification: A points based system where all activities are weighted evenly: completed exercises, group/team feedback, event attendance, and other admin at NSS.

- GitHub Integration: A lot of time is wasted searching through repos for exercise completion, grading, and it can be hard to keep up with the amount of exercises that are completed. Nevermind to option to get feedback on exercises and acknowledgement they have been reviewed.
- Tips to get started with GitHub
- Teacher-Student-Peer Communication: There are two ways students and teachers receive and give feedback. 
  - When a student completes an exercise they “submit it” to the teacher and await points and feedback. 
  - After a group presentation, points are awarded based on group feedback (forms), teacher feedback  and student goals. (Teacher awards points)
- Leaderboards: Showing the WEEKLY points for the house, cohort, and school and the students rank within those groups.
- Social Styles/Conflict Res building: By answering the initial questionnaire, students are placed in a “House” that represents their personality type. They also have access to information regarding the styles of others they will encounter. A key element is the ability to know what style others are and communicate accordingly, which will be reflected in their group feedback assessments.
- Skills Lists: Teachers give skills based on completed assignments and what skills were gained through its completion, which gives students an accurate assessment of the skills they have gained over the program.
- Focus on Areas of Interest: Often people aren’t able to focus on their goals because others don’t know what those goals are. This communication allows teachers a snapshot view of what the student would like to accomplish outside of the standard tech skills so that groups can be made accordingly. Groups are thus grouped by points, personality style, interests and skills.
- STRETCH GOAL: Admin view complete with graphs and trends.
- STRETCH GOAL: Students have the ability to print reports about their acquired skills and history.

### User Focused Goals
At the basic core, Read the Room is a todo list with the ability to complete exercises and tasks and get points for their completion. The ability to check off assignments as they are done helps students see where they are and where they want to go.

Based in years of research, the central theme of Read the Room is a sense of belonging identified by Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and human development. 
It is both difficult and unmanageable to foster a learning environment that is warm to every student. This app helps facilitate the process by giving students access to people who share their personality style through the use of  “houses” of other students at NSS and can also share their experiences by jumping in!

### My Goals
Solve a problem with data compilation and visualization
Create a way to help communication and success for students at NSS
Have the Angular and JS skills necessary to complete an app of this magnitude. 
Gain more tech project management skills.
